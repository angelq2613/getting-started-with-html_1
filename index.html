  <b>The Basics of Web and HTML</b>
<p> A web page is a text document written in language called<em>HTML</em><p><br>
<p>Web browsers read these documents and then interpret and displays them<p>
<br>
<b>How Coding Works</b>
<p>Coding happens when programmers write text in a <br>languge that a computer understands</p>
<p>The computer can then follow the instructions the progrmmers writes</p>
<em>For example:</em><br>
<b>I'm learning to code</b>  
learning then turns bold<br><br>
<b>The Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer wants</p><br>
<em>also known s writing with correct "syntax"</em><p> For example, if you forget to close a <b> tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold</p><br><br>
<em><b> Programmers can't Remember Everything</b><em>
  <p>There are too many details to keep everything in your head</p><br>
  <b>Basic HTML Vocabulary</b>
  <em>Tag:</em> 
  <p> an HTML tag is always contained within</p><br>angled brackets.Most <em><b>Tags</em></b>have an opening tag and a closing tag<br>
  Some tags called <em>void tags</em> do not require a closing tag.<br><br>
  <b><em>Element</b></em>
  an <b>HTML</b> <p>element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags</p><br><br>
  <b><em>Attributes</b></em>
  <p>This is a property of an <b>HTML</b> element. For example, to set the <em>href</em>of an anchor tag to <b>Udacity</b>URL, you would write<a href="www.udacity.com">
